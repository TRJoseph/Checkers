# Checkers

Welcome! This is a repository for my first Unity Project. This game attempts to re-create the classic board game, Checkers!

## In-Progress

This game is currently in development as I am currently a full time student at University making it relatively difficult to find time to pursue my own personal projects.

## Current Features
- Title Menu
- Turn-Based movement
- Correct movement functionality that mimics checkers.
- King pieces are created when player reaches the other side of the board

- Different levels of AI for the user to play against
